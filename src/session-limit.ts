 * KNOWN, BOUNDED RESIDUAL RISK (BUTCHR-259 review, comment 19465) — recorded
 * here rather than left implicit, per AC4's own standard that a mechanism's
 * limits must be legible, not just its successes:
 *
 * A tool result whose OWN output is, byte-for-byte, a genuine banner's
 * `⎿`-prefixed line immediately paired with its real wrap continuation
 * (`/upgrade`/`/usage-credits`), at margin depth 2, with nothing after it
 * that this module's guards recognise as disqualifying, IS indistinguishable
 * from a live refusal — and is currently recognised as one. Concretely: an
 * agent running `grep -A1 "hit your session limit" <a real capture file>`
 * (or `cat`/`Read` on any source that already contains those exact bytes)
 * produces exactly this shape. Verified directly against this
 * implementation, not theorised.
 *
 * Two candidate guards were tried and both FALSIFIED against real data
 * before concluding this can't be closed from pane text alone:
 *   - "reject a ⎿ line preceded by a tool-invocation line" — falsified by a
 *     genuine capture (BUTCHR-115) whose real banner is immediately preceded
 *     by "  Called butchr" with no invocation glyph: a session-limit
 *     failure can occur mid-turn, on what looks like a tool call, not only
 *     on the initial prompt — this would reject real banners too.
 *   - "require the pane's own last line to BE composer chrome" — doesn't
 *     discriminate: a faithfully-built adversarial pane is ALSO idle and
 *     ALSO ends in real composer chrome (the composer is unconditional
 *     idle-pane UI, not evidence either way about what produced the lines
 *     above it).
 *
 * Claude Code's rendering does not distinguish, in the text it prints,
 * between "the model's own turn was replaced with this refusal string" and
 * "a tool's actual output happens to equal this string" — both are an
 * identical `⎿`-headed, paired, chrome-terminated block. No further
 * structural signal is available to split them.
 *
 * Mitigations, not closures:
 *   - The poller's own `agent_status` idle/done gate (session-limit-watch.ts)
 *     still applies: the pane must have actually finished a turn in exactly
 *     this shape, not merely be mid-command.
 *   - Reproducing the exact bytes (real `⎿` + NBSP) requires the SOURCE data
 *     already contain them verbatim — in practice, a real pane capture file
 *     or this repo's own fixtures/docs. The exposure is narrow and largely
 *     confined to agents working this epic, not the general fleet.
 *
 * What would close it: a signal at the SOURCE (herdr's `pane.read`, or
 * Claude Code itself) distinguishing a genuine API-refusal substitution
 * from ordinary tool-result text — e.g. structured output that tags which
 * segments are model-generated versus tool-returned, rather than the
 * flattened ANSI-stripped string this module receives today. Not available
 * currently; not implemented here.

 * detection work — see the BUTCHR-259 measurement on the pairing-based path
 * above it, which does not consult this constant at all.
 *
 * BUTCHR-259 measured every real `⎿`-prefixed banner across a 52-file/97-
 * occurrence corpus of genuine captures and found content-line depth from
 * the end of the pane ranging from 5 to 25, with ZERO at depth <= 4 — so

 * NONE of them; BUTCHR-241 already established separately that even a widened
 * fixed budget alone doesn't help, because the anchor rejects a `⎿`-prefixed
 * line regardless of position. Both findings are why this module no longer
 * uses a fixed depth budget to decide whether a `⎿`-prefixed refusal is
 * live: the depth varies too much (composer chrome, a completion-status
 * line, the banner's own wrap, AND — found independently while building
 * this fix — arbitrary bordered notification/monitor boxes that can land
 * between the banner and the pane's tail with unenumerable free text; see
 * BOX_LINE below) for any fixed or vocabulary-bounded window to reliably
 * reach every genuine banner without either missing real ones or, if
 * widened enough to reach depth 25, reopening the exact false-close risk
 * TAIL_LINES was introduced to close.
 *
 * This constant is kept only for the legacy bare-line path: a refusal with
 * NO tool-result prefix at all is not how Claude Code renders a live
 * refusal (every real capture in the corpus above IS `⎿`-prefixed), so that
 * path exists solely so hand-built text (existing tests, and any future
 * caller that hands this module plain text with no pane chrome) keeps
 * working exactly as before — it carries none of the false-close risk the
 * `⎿`-path's pairing guard exists for, so the same discipline (position

 *    position-bounded, because BUTCHR-259 measured genuine banners sitting

 *    anything at all since (proven by there being real content between the
 *    two), the session cannot still be the one that's refused. Once found,
 *    it is decided immediately, live or suppressed — earlier occurrences
 *    are never consulted as a fallback.
 *
 *    Decided live only if BOTH:
 *      (a) the very next raw line matches the banner's own known wrap
 *          continuation (BANNER_CONTINUATION) — the primary guard, and
 *      (b) nothing looks like FURTHER embedded content after that
 *          continuation (embeddedAfter) — a defense-in-depth guard against

 *          two-line pair verbatim and then keeps going (more ticket prose,
 *          a `… +N lines (ctrl+o to expand)` truncation tail).
 *    Anything else on this path is `suppressed`, with a reason.
 *
 * 2. Legacy bare-line path (see TAIL_LINES): only reached if no `⎿`-
 *    prefixed candidate was found at all. Unchanged in behaviour from
