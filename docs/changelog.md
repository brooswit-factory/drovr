# Changelog

## 0.3.2

- Add `prepareManagedAgentWorkspace({ provider, cwd, unattended }, settingsPath?)`.
  For unattended AGY launches, trust the exact existing realpath directory in
  `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`. Root, home, and ancestors of home
  are refused. Other providers and attended launches are no-ops.
- Preserve other settings and trust entries, reject malformed settings without
  overwriting them, serialize calls within the process, and replace settings
  atomically using a private temporary file. Tests use isolated fixture settings.
- Keep workspace preparation separate from `buildAgentStartParams`:
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` does not dismiss AGY's workspace trust screen,
  and trusting a parent directory does not trust its children.

Release asset: `brooswit-drovr-0.3.2.tgz`.

## 0.3.1

- Add `AgyAgentLaunch.skipPermissions?: boolean` and export the launch type from
  the package entry point. Explicit `true` adds `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
  to AGY launch arguments; omitted or false preserves the existing behavior.
- Clarify that AGY inherits cwd from its pane and uses external MCP configuration,
  including stdio-to-HTTP bridges. No cwd, MCP, or workspace-trust flags are added.

Release asset: `brooswit-drovr-0.3.1.tgz`. Consumers must update their dependency
URL and lockfile after the matching `v0.3.1` GitHub release is published.
