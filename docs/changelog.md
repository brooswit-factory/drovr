# Changelog

## 0.3.1

- Add `AgyAgentLaunch.skipPermissions?: boolean` and export the launch type from
  the package entry point. Explicit `true` adds `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
  to AGY launch arguments; omitted or false preserves the existing behavior.
- Clarify that AGY inherits cwd from its pane and uses external MCP configuration,
  including stdio-to-HTTP bridges. No cwd, MCP, or workspace-trust flags are added.

Release asset: `brooswit-drovr-0.3.1.tgz`. Consumers must update their dependency
URL and lockfile after the matching `v0.3.1` GitHub release is published.
